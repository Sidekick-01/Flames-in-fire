                                                        🔥 FLAMES in Fire 🍔
Welcome to Flavortown FLAMES, the ultimate compatibility calculator with a culinary twist! Instead of boring text results, this app serves up destiny on a plate using custom "Fate Panels" featuring our signature Chef characters.

                                                         👨‍🍳 What is this?
FLAMES is a classic game used to predict the relationship between two people. We've modernized it with a "Chef’s Special" UI, using glassmorphism effects and custom-generated artwork to make revealing your fate an interactive experience.

                                                   🛠️ Project Structure
Your project is organized for professional deployment:

                                                   💻 Technical Implementation
The app uses a specific algorithm to determine the relationship:

Character Stripping: Removes common letters between both names.

The Count: Sums the remaining unique characters.

The Culling: Loops through the "FLAMES" array, removing elements based on the count until only one remains.

The Reveal: Maps the final string to a specific image path in the assets folder.
