# Flames-in-fire
# 🔥 FLAMES on Arch
A funny calculator that connects to my private Arch Linux MariaDB.

### Features:
- **Server Status:** Click the top-left box. It tells you if data is being saved or if we are in "Stealth Mode."
- **Comedy:** I know you're too scared to talk to your crush, so I'll save the names for you.
- **Local Mode:** If my Arch server is off, the site still works but doesn't save anything.

Made for Flavourtown 2026.
